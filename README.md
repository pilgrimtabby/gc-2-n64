# gc-2-n64

PCB for a gamecube to N64 controller adapter using RaphaÃ«l Assenat's v2.1 gc_to_n64 ([here](https://www.raphnet.net/electronique/gc_to_n64/index_en.php), see also [here](https://github.com/raphnet/gc_to_n64])).

The PCB design was heavily inspired and drawn from [SuperSpongo's DIY adapter design](https://circuit-board.de/forum/index.php/Thread/28130-Raphnets-GameCube-Controller-to-N64-Adapter-v2/).
